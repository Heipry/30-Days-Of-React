This repo will be updated daily throughout the month. When a new day's content becomes available, you can update your forked copy with the steps below.

# 1. switch to master branch
git checkout master
# 2. check if your local copy has a link to original `...Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-React.git`
git remote -v
# 3. if not, add a link to original, you can choose any name for the link or use `upstream`
git remote add upstream git@github.com:Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-React.git
# 4. check again to confirm link added
git remote -v
# 5. now you can fetch updates from original repo, assuming you named this `upstream`
git fetch upstream
# 6. merge the updates to your local master branch
git merge upstream/master master
# 7. push the merged updates to your Forked copy on GitHub
git push origin master
Note that the updates are only applied to the master branch. If you wish to update any other branch, repeat steps 6-7 with the branch name. See snippet below for exercise-solutions branch

git merge upstream/master exercise-solutions
git push origin exercise-solutions
